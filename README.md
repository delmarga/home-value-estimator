# Home Value Estimator - Machine Learning

This is an example of how web applications use Supervised Machine Learning models to do value predictions to determine how much a house is worth.

The purpose of the Home Value Estimator is to predict the value of a home based on its attributes such as, total sqft, livable sqft, year built and number of bedrooms. The Gradient Descent algorithm was used for the estimator.
